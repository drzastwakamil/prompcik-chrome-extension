**Clean structure with 3 organized docs + architecture guide + cleanup summary**

---

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Removed All Leftovers
- ✅ Deleted old `.old` files from pre-Vue code
- ✅ Removed demo/prototype HTML files
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate manifest.json

### 2. Fixed Manifest Configuration
- ✅ Removed unused root `manifest.json`
- ✅ Confirmed `manifest-dist.json` is the single source of truth
- ✅ Build process correctly copies manifest to `dist/`

### 3. Consolidated Documentation
- ✅ Reduced from 9 docs to 4 organized files
- ✅ Created `docs/` folder for better organization
- ✅ Updated all cross-references in README.md
- ✅ Preserved historical information in archive

### 4. Analyzed Architecture
- ✅ No dead code found - refactoring was clean
- ✅ All components are actively used
- ✅ No unused imports or variables
- ✅ Documented potential improvements in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`

---

## 📊 Impact

### Before Cleanup
- **Files in root:** 20+ files (source, config, docs mixed together)
- **Documentation:** 9 scattered files with overlapping content
- **Old code:** 3 `.old` files and 1 demo file taking up space
- **Confusion:** Which manifest is used? Which docs to read?

### After Cleanup
- **Files in root:** Clean - only essential config files
- **Documentation:** 4 well-organized files in `docs/` folder
- **Old code:** Completely removed
- **Clarity:** Clear structure, single source of truth for everything

### Metrics
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Root-level docs | 9 files | 1 file (+ docs/) | 89% reduction |
| Documentation files | 9 | 4 | 56% reduction |
| Old code files | 3 | 0 | 100% removed |
| Demo/prototype files | 1 (501 lines) | 0 | 100% removed |
| Manifest files | 2 | 1 | Eliminated duplication |

## 🔍 Dead Code Analysis

### Findings
- ✅ **No dead code found in Vue components**
- ✅ **All imports are necessary**
- ✅ **All utility functions are used**
- ✅ **No unused variables or functions**

The refactoring from plain JS to Vue was done cleanly - old code was properly removed, and new code is lean and efficient.

## 🎯 Architecture Assessment

### Strengths
- ✅ Clean component separation (4 well-defined Vue components)
- ✅ Proper two-config build system (IIFE for content, ES modules for popup)
- ✅ Good file organization
- ✅ Reactive state management
- ✅ No global state pollution

### Current File Structure
```
chrome_extension/
├── src/
│   ├── components/          # Vue components (4 files)
│   ├── content/            # Content script entry
│   └── popup/              # Popup entry
├── dist/                   # Build output (gitignored)
├── docs/                   # Documentation (4 files)
├── scripts/                # Build scripts
├── background.js           # Service worker
├── popup.html              # Popup template
├── styles.css              # Global styles
├── manifest-dist.json      # Manifest template
├── vite.config.js          # Content build config
├── vite.config.popup.js    # Popup build config
└── package.json            # Dependencies
```

### Recommended Next Steps (See `docs/ARCHITECTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`)
1. **High Priority:** Add testing infrastructure (Vitest)
2. **High Value:** Consider TypeScript migration
3. **Medium Priority:** Improve accessibility
4. **Medium Priority:** Better CSS organization
5. **Medium Priority:** Enhanced error handling
