# Quick Fix - Extension Not Loading

## 🔧 The Issue

The extension isn't loading because Chrome may be trying to load from the wrong location.

## ✅ Solution (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Reload from Correct Location

1. **Open Chrome Extensions:**
   ```
   chrome://extensions/
   ```

2. **Remove the old extension:**
   - Find "Fake News Filter"
   - Click "Remove" button

3. **Load from correct location:**
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Navigate to your project folder
   - **SELECT THE `dist/` FOLDER** (not the root!)
   - Click "Select Folder"

4. **Verify:**
   - Extension should now appear with version 1.0.0
   - Toggle should be ON (blue)

### Option 2: Quick Reload (if already pointing to dist/)

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Fake News Filter"
3. Click the reload icon (🔄)
4. Refresh any test webpage

## ✅ Verification

After loading, you should see:
- ✅ Extension appears in Chrome toolbar
- ✅ No errors in extensions page
- ✅ Visit any webpage and see the floating toolbar

## 📁 Important Note

**Always load the `dist/` folder, not the root folder!**

The root folder is for source code. The `dist/` folder contains the built extension that Chrome needs.

## 🎯 Why This Happened

During cleanup, I removed the root `manifest.json` because:
- The build system uses `manifest-dist.json` as the source
- It copies it to `dist/manifest.json` during build
- Chrome should load from `dist/`, not root

If Chrome was pointing to the root folder, it would fail when the root manifest was deleted.

## 🚀 You're All Set!

The extension has been successfully built and is ready to use from the `dist/` folder.
